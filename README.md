### File organization
This repository contains code and datasheets that are used in an rproject ("_for_rproj") and code + datasheets that are standalone ("_for_standalone"). Double check that file paths are correct. 

### Data Availability
All data processing and analysis code is available within this repository. All raw soil temperature NEON data is cited in the manuscript, and available for download via NEON data portal (https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/explore), or via download code in "code_for_rproj". Supporting site and soil data is available through the Environmental Data Initiative (https://edirepository.org/) as cited in the manuscript. Additional site and soil data (organic mat thickness, precipitation as snow) is available as raw data within this repository.
